    <h1>Week 1 Blog</h1>
    <h1>Exploring the Roadmap of the Internet's Journey</h1>

    <section class="section-content">
        <p>In delving into the readings from Berners-Lee and Bush, it feels like unraveling the roadmap of the internet's journey. Initially, envision the internet as a grand meeting space, conceived by the early trailblazers. Fast forward, and we find ourselves in a global arena of instantaneous communication and information access.</p>

        <p>Bush's brainchild, hypertext, laid the groundwork for the interconnected nature of the internet we navigate today – the realm of hyperlinks, search engines, and seamlessly linked websites. The concept of user empowerment and creativity, a shared vision among these early thinkers, has materialized in the proliferation of social media and blogging platforms. Individuals now have the power to contribute actively, shaping the digital landscape.</p>

        <p>Engelbart's futuristic vision of technological augmentation has become a reality through the integration of AI and virtual reality, enhancing our cognitive abilities in unforeseen ways. Yet, amidst this progress, the dream of open access and collaboration has collided with the pragmatism of commercialization and growing privacy concerns.</p>

        <p>The internet, once envisioned as a space for shared knowledge, has morphed into a complex space, prompting reflections on finding a delicate balance between accessibility and safeguarding user privacy. This exploration underscores the intricate interplay between original visionary ideals and the nuanced realities shaping the internet we traverse today.</p>
