    <h1>My Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h1>

    <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
    <p>Let's start with the folder structure. Keeping things organized is crucial for maintaining a tidy and manageable website. Here's how I've structured my folders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Root</li>
        <ul>
            <li>index.html</li>
            <li>blog.html</li>
            <li>essays.html</li>
            <li>Images/</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Image.jpg</li>
                <li>Cartoon.jpg</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>URL Scheme</h2>
    <p>Now, let's delve into the URL scheme. A clean and intuitive URL structure enhances user experience and makes navigation easier. Here's how I've designed my URLs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Home Page: Visit <a href="https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2540640/">Home Page</a> to land on the home page. This URL corresponds to index.html, which serves as the starting point for exploration.</li>
        <li>Blog Section: Interested in my blog posts? Head over to <a href="https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2540640/blog.html">Blog Section</a>. This URL grants direct access to my latest musings.</li>
        <li>Essays Section: To dive into my essays, simply navigate to <a href="https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2540640/essays.html">Essays Section</a>. Here, you'll find a collection of thought-provoking pieces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Decision-Making Process</h2>
    <p>When deciding on my folder structure and URL scheme, several factors came into play:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplicity: I aimed for a simple and easy-to-understand structure that wouldn't confuse anyone viewing my website.</li>
        <li>Consistency: Maintaining consistency across URLs ensures a seamless browsing experience. By following a consistent pattern, users can predict and navigate to different sections effortlessly.</li>
        <li>Scalability: The chosen layout accommodates future growth and expansion, allowing for smooth scaling as my site evolves.</li>
        <li>Efficiency: The chosen structure allows for efficient management of files and resources, making it convenient for both users and me as the site owner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking these factors into account, I've established a foundation that promotes accessibility, usability, and engagement.</p>

    <p>Oh um, one puzzling issue I've encountered is the inability to view the cute images on my live website. Trust me, I've scratched my head over this one too! Rest assured, I'm actively investigating the issue and working towards a resolution. In the meantime, just view my website without the images, thank you.</p>

    <h1>Reflection on the Reading</h1>
    <h2>Hypertext: Where Creativity Takes the Wheel</h2>
    <p>Hypertext emerges as a catalyst for change, offering users a platform to transcend traditional boundaries of information consumption and production. Moulthrop's exploration of hypertext as a democratizing force underscores its role in empowering individuals to engage with, contribute to, and shape the digital landscape. It's like a digital revolution where everyone gets to be a rebel with a cause â€“ the cause of shaping their own narrative in the vast expanse of cyberspace.</p>

    <h2>McLuhan's Laws of Media: Navigating the Digital Currents</h2>
    <p>Each law serves as a guiding beacon, illuminating the intricate interplay between technology, culture, and society in shaping the internet as we know it today. It's a reminder that while technology may change, the fundamental principles of human interaction and communication remain constant.</p>

    <h2>From Xanadu to the WWW: Tracing the Evolution of Digital Ideals</h2>
    <p>Moulthrop's engagement with Theodor Holm Nelson's concept of Xanadu as a globally accessible library of information monitored by a link-and-retrieve system paints a visionary picture of a digital landscape that parallels the emergence of the WWW. Nelson's vision of Xanadu foreshadows the interconnected web of information that we now navigate daily.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, Moulthrop's essay isn't just a stroll down memory lane; it's a critical examination of the digital frontier, peppered with moments of insight and flashes of inspiration. As we navigate the ever-changing landscape of the internet, let us heed the lessons of the past and approach the digital realm with humility, responsibility, and a commitment to fostering meaningful dialogue and collaboration.</p>

    <h1>Reflecting on Interaction and Its Significance within the World Wide Web</h1>
    <p>For me, interaction transcends mere clicks and scrolls; it embodies a dynamic exchange of ideas, experiences, and emotions that bridges the gap between individuals and the digital world.</p>
    <p>Interaction, in the context of the web, is about more than just user interface elements or design aesthetics. It's about creating meaningful connections, fostering engagement, and empowering users to actively participate in shaping their online experiences.</p>
    <p>To me, interaction means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engagement: Interaction is about captivating the audience's attention and inviting them to immerse themselves in the digital environment. Whether through compelling visuals, interactive elements, or thought-provoking content, effective interaction captures the user's interest and encourages them to explore further.</li>
        <li>Connection: Interaction fosters connections, enabling users to connect with each other and with the content they encounter.</li>
        <li>Accessibility: Interaction is inclusive, ensuring that digital experiences are accessible to users of all abilities. From intuitive navigation to assistive technologies, the web strives to remove barriers and create a seamless experience for everyone, regardless of their individual circumstances.</li>
        <li>Feedback: Interaction involves a two-way exchange of information, with users providing feedback and input that shapes the evolution of digital services.</li>
    </ul>
