        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Ying, though most people call me Anna. Currently, I'm navigating the academic waters at the University of the Witwatersrand. Now, I'll be honest ,I don't have a list of interests that light up my world, but that's okay. Life's about exploration, right? I'm still on the hunt for that one thing that'll make me jump out of bed in the morning. Back in the day, I had a thing for painting, but high school Art class kind of put a damper on that.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>As a Chinese individual, I don't fit into the typical stereotype. I might not be a genius, but math have always intrigued me, and you'll often find me tinkering away on the piano keys. Born in 2003 and practicing Islam, I'm a blend of cultures and experiences that shape who I am.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In terms of interests, I'm all about the simple pleasures in life: sleeping, eating, and scrolling through TikTok for hours on end.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal? Simple yet ambitious. I want to walk across that stage, grab my degree, maybe pursue a master's or dive into another field – perhaps something in the realm of business. Dream big, right? Ultimately, I envision myself with a PhD, juggling the responsibilities of academia with the joys of being a housewife. Oh, and there's this little dream of mine to open a cozy coffee shop or some other type of shop – who knows? If all else fails, I'll roll up my sleeves and dive into the workforce. Life's an adventure, and I'm ready for whatever it throws my way.</p>
