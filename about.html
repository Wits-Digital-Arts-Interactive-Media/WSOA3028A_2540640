            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>As a Chinese individual, I don't fit into the typical stereotype. I might not be a genius, but math has always intrigued me, and you'll often find me tinkering away on the piano keys. Born in 2003 and practicing Islam, I'm a blend of cultures and experiences that shape who I am.</p>

        <section class="section-content left">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal? Simple yet ambitious. I want to walk across that stage, grab my degree, maybe pursue a master's or dive into another field – perhaps something in the realm of business. Dream big, right? Ultimately, I envision myself with a PhD, juggling the responsibilities of academia with the joys of being a housewife. Oh, and there's this little dream of mine to open a cozy coffee shop or some other type of shop – who knows? If all else fails, I'll roll up my sleeves and dive into the workforce. Life's an adventure, and I'm ready for whatever it throws my way.</p>

            <h2>You're wondering about my daily grind, huh?</h2>
            <p> Well, hold onto your laptop, because it's about to get wild. Picture this: I kick off my day with the most intense sport of all time—sleeping. Then, I morph into a chief and whip up some breakfast (or at least pour cereal). Next, I go on the thrilling adventure known as "campus," where I conquer assignment and lectures like a true hero. And just when you think it can't get any more fun , I wrap it all up with a theee best thing —going back to bed. Yep, my life's a rollercoaster of excitement. </p>

        <section class="section-content left">
            <h2>Passion</h2>
            <p>Absolutely! I find joy in the little things: enjoying a good meal, getting lost in doodles, and letting music fill the air with my piano. But you know what? I also cherish my alone time, those moments of blissful nothingness. And as for the future? Well, I've got dreams, like anyone else. Maybe one day I'll hit the jackpot, thanks to my future hubby. Inshallah, Ameen </p>
